# ansible-base

Base directory for Ansible playbooks

## Main usage

That is primarily my own start for a new Ansible Playbook. But feel free to look around ...

Start by copying the _Makefile.template_ to _Makefile_. This avoids conflicts with updates in the repository.

```
cp -a Makefile.template Makefile
make all
```
